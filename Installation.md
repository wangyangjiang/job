**To Install:**

1. Clone or download the repository to a new web directory (do not attempt to upgrade an old FusionInvoice installation)

2. Run "composer install" in web directory

3. create a NEW BillingTrack database.

    _You will be presented with an option to transfer an existing FusionInvoice 2018-8 database during setup._

4. Copy .env.example to .env

5. edit .env and change:

    DB_HOST=
    
    DB_DATABASE=
    
    DB_USERNAME=
    
    DB_PASSWORD=
    
    to your **NEW** database settings.

    _Do not set APP_DEBUG to true. On a large database transfer it will cause a failure._
    _If you need to run debug, wait until setup is complete and app is running._

6. save .env file.

    **FOR NEW INSTALL:**
        Run "php artisan key:generate"
        Copy generated key to (APP_KEY=base64:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
    
        Save .env file and exit.

    **FOR UPGRADE FROM 2018-8:**
        Add your existing FusionInvoice 2018-8 app key to (APP_KEY= xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
    
        Save .env file and exit.

7. Set permissions for your site.

8. Start BillingTrack/setup

9. after database configuration finishes, you will be presented with 2 choices:

    **Create new account** -> creates fresh installation with account

    **Transfer existing 2018-8 database** -> enter EXACT existing 2018-8 database name and data will be transfered to new database and structure.
    
    Note: This can take a long time on a large database (i.e. 30 MiB = ~ 10 minutes). This function will transfer **only** existing FusionInvoice 2018-8. If you have an older version it will need to be upgraded to 2018-8.
    2018-8 is available in the release section of this repository.
    This will also transfer the cytech/workorders addon, cytech/scheduler addon and fusioninvoice/TimeTracking addon if they exist.
    Any other addons will have to be reinstalled and data manually transferred.
    Also, there is a limit of 10 custom fields columns transferred per _module_custom_ table. If you have more than 10 custom fields columns defined in any _module_custom_ table you will need to edit the code in SetupController.php line 201 and increase the
    value from 10 to the maximum number of your custom field columns.
